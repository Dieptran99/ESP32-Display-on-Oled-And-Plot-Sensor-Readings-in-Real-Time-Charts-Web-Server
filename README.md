# ESP32-Display-on-Oled-And-Plot-Sensor-Readings-in-Real-Time-Charts-Web-Server
This guide shows how to plot sensor readings (temperature and humidity) on a web server using the ESP32  with Arduino IDE, and display on Oled 1.3in (driver SH1106). The ESP will host a web page with three real time charts that have new readings added every 30 seconds.
